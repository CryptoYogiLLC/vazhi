Natural doesn't mean: 1) No side effects (many herbs have), 2) No interactions (herb-drug interactions real), 3) Safe for everyone (allergies, conditions), 4) Any amount is okay (overdose possible). Examples: 1) Neem - excess can harm liver, 2) Turmeric - blood thinner interaction, 3) Aloe - not for pregnant, 4) Some herbs toxic in large doses. Safe approach: 1) Moderate amounts, 2) Inform doctors, 3) Buy quality products, 4) Watch for reactions.",
